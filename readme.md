# About SelenaBot

SelenaBot is an app that uses BeautifulSoup and JSON to scrape instagram accounts:
* It is named after Selena Gomez, the queen of instagram.
* It outputs the files in their original JPGs with the filepaths 'username_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM'
* It can't handle video yet, videos are currently downloaded as a JPG of the first frame

The long term plan is to have it set up to scrape a variety of different instagram accounts, controllable through the console/command line
The first application is top100, which scrapes the top 100 most-followed instagram accounts and download their most recent images (i.e. the most recent 12 that appear on the site)
